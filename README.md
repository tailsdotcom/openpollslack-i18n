# About this fork 

I have made some changes to make it more customizable, such as:
- Allowing choices to be added by others
- Simple Scheduled Poll
- Advanced Schedule and Recurring Poll Using Cron Expression
- True anonymous voting (Poller can't see users' votes if this mode is ON): Default ON
- Supporting Slack's Enterprise Grid and Slack Connect
- Create poll in private channel without adding bot to that channel using just `/poll`
  - (Except create via shortcut and Schedule/Recurring Poll which still required adding bot to channel)
- Customizable UI (Order, Show/Hide elements you don't want to make it cleaner)
- i18n, UI Language, multiple language support (Please feel free to report any mistranslations)
- Separate configuration for each Slack team
- Better error handling to prevent crashes on the server
- Log to file

(Please see detail below)

### If I just want to use it without self-host?
You can use "Add to slack" button [on this site](https://siamhos.com/openpollplus/index_plus.html)
or visit [Slack app directory](https://slack.com/apps/A04EQUT9X1C) 

PLEASE NOTE: The link above will run the latest code on my development server. You can use it for free, but it may contain bugs or may be down for maintenance without any notice. If you find any bugs, please feel free to report them.

After adding the app to Slack, please use the `/poll config` command to configure which options you want to enable or disable on your Slack team.

**If you have trouble adding app to Slack or creating poll, try to uninstall it first then reinstall as you might have old version that not compatible with current version(version before App was published to Slack app dir.)** 

If you didn't use any of these Feature you might want to use original App here [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/openpollslack/openpollslack).

## Usages

### Simple and scheduled poll via user interface
Just type `/poll` (without any options) in the channel that you want to post!
```
/poll
```
(If `/poll` is being used by other app you can also use `/openpoll`)
![poll-modal-en-v4.png](./assets/poll-modal-en-v4.png)

### Simple poll via command
```
/poll "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

- For both the question and your choices, please surround them with "quotes"
- For options, DO NOT surround them with quotes unless specified.
- If you have "Double Quotation" in your question or choices, escaped quotes it with `\"`.
(Supported double quote:  `"` `“` `”` `‟` `„` `〝` `〞` `〟`)
- For `\ ` escaped with `\\`
- You can use @mention and Slack's emoji 😀 🤩 🤗 , `*bold*` `~strike~` `_italics_` and `` `code` `` in question and choices
```
/poll "Please select \"HELLO\" ?" "HELLO" "HELlo" "helLo" "HE\"LL\"O"
```


### Anonymous poll
```
/poll anonymous "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```
### Limited choice poll
```
/poll limit 2 "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```
### Hidden poll votes
```
/poll hidden "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```
### Anonymous limited choice poll
```
/poll anonymous limit 2 "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

### Allow choices add by others
```
/poll add-choice "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

### Allow choices add by others with Limited and Anonymous
```
/poll add-choice anonymous limit 2 "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

### Change poll language for current poll only
```
/poll lang th "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

### Allow choices add by others
```
/poll add-choice "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

### Change poll language for current poll only
```
/poll lang th "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```

### Simple Schedule Poll
Schedule post
```
/poll on 2023-11-15T10:30:00+07:00 "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```
Schedule post and close
```
/poll on 2023-11-15T10:30:00+07:00 end 2023-11-30T00:00:00+07:00 "What's your favourite color ?" "Red" "Green" "Blue" "Yellow"
```
- Time stamp should be in ISO8601 format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`
- If an end time is set, it will attempt to close the poll at that time once. If the owner re-opens it, the scheduled close will not run again.

### Advanced Schedule/Recurring Poll
For advanced recurring polls, please use a simple poll as a template and then use the `POLL_ID` of that poll in the `/poll schedule` command. If you don't want any members to see or respond to your template poll, you can create it in an empty private channel and specify the `CH_ID` in the schedule command.

Schedule a poll that create by yourself:
```
/poll schedule create [POLL_ID] [TS] [CH_ID] "[CRON_EXP]" [MAX_RUN]
```
Example:
```
/poll schedule create 0123456789abcdef01234567 2023-11-18T08:00:00+07:00
/poll schedule create 0123456789abcdef01234567 2023-11-15T10:30:00+07:00 - "30 12 15 * *" 12
/poll schedule create 0123456789abcdef01234567 2023-11-15T10:30:00+07:00 C0000000000 "30 12 15 * *" 12
```
Schedule poll that create by others in your team
(this command only work on user who install app to Slack only):
```
/poll schedule create_force [POLL_ID] [TS] [CH_ID] "[CRON_EXP]" [MAX_RUN]
```
- Bot MUST in the channel.
- Only one schedule for each poll, reschedule will replace previous one.
- `POLL_ID` = ID of poll to schedule (eg. `0123456789abcdef01234567`).
  - To get Poll ID: go to exist poll > `Menu` > `Command Info.`.
- `TS` = Time stamp of first run (ISO8601 format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, eg. `2023-11-17T21:54:00+07:00`).
- `CH_ID` = (Optional) Channel ID to post the poll, set to `-` to post to orginal channel that poll was created (eg. `A0123456`).
  - To get channel ID: go to your channel, Click down arrow next to channel name, channel ID will be at the very bottom.
- `CRON_EXP` = (Optional) Do not set to run once, or put [cron expression](https://github.com/polppol/openpollslack-i18n#supported-cron-expression-format) in UTC Timezone (with `"`Double Quote`"`) here (eg. `"30 12 15 * *"` , Post poll 12:30 PM on the 15th day of every month in UTC).
- `MAX_RUN` = (Optional) Do not set to run maximum time that server allows (`schedule_max_run` times), After Run Counter greater than this number; schedule will disable itself.

NOTE: If a cron expression results in having more than 1 job within `schedule_limit_hrs` hours, the Poll will post once, and then the job will get disabled.

#### Supported cron expression format
```
*    *    *    *    *
┬    ┬    ┬    ┬    ┬
│    │    │    │    |
│    │    │    │    └ day of week (0 - 7, 1L - 7L) (0 or 7 is Sun)
│    │    │    └───── month (1 - 12)
│    │    └────────── day of month (1 - 31, L)
│    └─────────────── hour (0 - 23)
└──────────────────── minute (0 - 59)
```

##### Example
- `30 8 * * *` -> at 8:00 AM, Every day
- `10 * * 1,3,5` -> at 10:00 AM on every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- `45 13 * * 1-5` -> at 1:45 PM on every Monday to Friday.
- `15 9 * * 5L` -> at 9:15 AM on last Friday of every month.

### List Schedule/Recurring Poll
List all scheduled poll that create by current user:
```
/poll schedule list
/poll schedule list_self
```

List all scheduled poll in workspace
(this command only work on user who install app to Slack only):
```
/poll schedule list_all
```

### Delete Schedule/Recurring Poll
Delete schedule that create by yourself:
```
/poll schedule delete [POLL_ID]
```
Delete schedule that create by others in your team

if you host this by your self you can make change this in `schedule_auto_delete_invalid_day`

# Override configuration 

There are three levels of configuration: Server, Team, and User. 

The User configuration has the highest priority, followed by Team, and then Server. 

Please note that some configurations may not be available for override at certain levels.


## User configuration (Override Team configuration)

Read or set config for yourself, If both User and Team config exist; User config will be used.
Usage:
```
/poll user_config read
/poll user_config write [config_name]
/poll user_config write user_allow_dm [true/false]
/poll user_config reset
```

## Team configuration (Override Server configuration)

If some of your team would like to using different config than what is on default.json you can use `/poll config` .
- This command only work on user who install app to Slack only
- If app was re-add to workspace all Override config will be carry over for you

Usage:
```
/poll config read
/poll config write app_lang [zh_tw/zh_cn/th/ru/kr/jp/fr/es/en/de/(or language file)]
/poll config write app_lang_user_selectable [true/false]
/poll config write app_allow_dm [true/false]
/poll config write menu_at_the_end [true/false]
